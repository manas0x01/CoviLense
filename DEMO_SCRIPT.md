- **Results Analysis**: Show formatted results with key findings and recommendations

*"Instead of writing complex Elasticsearch queries, analysts can ask questions in plain English. The system uses advanced NLP to understand intent and generate optimized queries."*

**Example Conversation Flow:**
1. User: "Show suspicious login attempts yesterday"
2. AI: Shows 23 suspicious attempts with detailed breakdown
3. User: "Focus on IP 192.168.1.45"
4. AI: Provides deep dive analysis with 15 failed attempts and threat assessment

#### 3. Threat Analytics Deep Dive (1 minute)
- **Geographic Attack Distribution**: Map showing attack sources by country
- **Attack Vector Trends**: Ransomware up 45%, APT campaigns active
- **Critical Threat Intelligence**: Active APT-2024-001 targeting government infrastructure
- **IOC Management**: 47 new indicators detected with confidence scoring

*"Our threat intelligence module provides advanced analytics on attack patterns, helping analysts understand the evolving threat landscape."*

#### 4. Investigation Management (1 minute)
- **Case Tracking**: Show active investigations with status tracking
- **Multi-turn Context**: Demonstrate how the system remembers context across questions
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate PDF reports with charts and findings
- **Team Collaboration**: Share investigations across team members

*"The investigation management system maintains context throughout the investigation, allowing analysts to build on previous queries and findings."*

#### 5. Technical Innovation Highlights (1 minute)
